## Approximate Bayesian Computation
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a class of likelihood-free inference methods used when the likelihood function is either unavailable or computationally expensive to evaluate. Rather than computing likelihoods explicitly, ABC infers posterior distributions by simulating data from the model and comparing it to observed data using distance metrics or summary statistics. Originally developed in the context of population genetics, ABC has evolved to accommodate high-dimensional models and noisy data through algorithmic enhancements such as ABC with regression adjustment, ABC-MCMC, ABC-SMC, and machine learning-based methods.

ABC is particularly useful in complex dynamical systems, stochastic biological networks, and real-world scenarios where exact likelihood computation is infeasible. Its flexibility and model-agnostic nature make it widely applicable in epidemiology, systems biology, ecology, engineering, technological forecasting, and other fields where mathematical models are complex and analytically intractable.

ABC methods offer a unique advantage in situations where:

- The likelihood function is analytically unavailable or too complex to evaluate.
- Simulators can easily generate synthetic data from proposed model parameters.
- Domain experts can define reasonable distance metrics and summary statistics to compare simulated and observed data.

Over the past two decades, significant advancements have expanded the scope of ABC, enabling it to handle stochastic processes, time-series data, dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations, and high-dimensional parameter spaces.

## Overview of Simulation Studies
he simulation studies demonstrate the practical application of the ABC rejection algorithm to infer parameters from data generated by models with intractable likelihoods:

- Study I: Normal Distribution
Parameters of a normal distribution (mean and standard deviation) are estimated using ABC rejection. Posterior samples are derived by comparing empirical quantiles between observed and simulated datasets.

- Study II: Logistic Growth Curve Model
Parameters (growth rate and carrying capacity) of a logistic growth model are estimated using ABC. Simulated trajectories are matched to noisy observations using Euclidean distance, illustrating ABC’s capacity to recover dynamics of population growth models.

These simulations highlight how ABC enables approximate inference even when traditional likelihood-based methods are not feasible.
 

## Overview of Case Studies
Two real-world case studies are included to illustrate the applicability of ABC in empirical settings:

- Case Study I: LCD-TV Adoption Data
The Gompertz model is employed to analyze the diffusion of LCD-TV technology using sales data from Taiwan (2003–2007). ABC rejection sampling is used to infer the intrinsic growth rate and saturation rate, showing strong model-data alignment despite computational demands.

- Case Study II: Horse and Mule Populations in the U.S.
A time-varying logistic growth model is fitted to historical agricultural data (1865–1960) capturing the rise and decline of horse and mule populations. ABC rejection sampling is used to estimate dynamic carrying capacity, incorporating time dependency in model structure.

These case studies exemplify how ABC facilitates flexible modeling in domains where traditional inference methods fall short due to model complexity or data irregularities.

## Significance of the Work

This work provides a comprehensive demonstration of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methodologies through both simulated and real-world applications, showcasing ABC’s versatility across multiple scientific domains. The full implementation in the Julia programming language, using the GpABC.jl package, offers an efficient, open-source, and reproducible computational platform that can be readily adapted for teaching, research, and practical applications. By bridging theoretical principles with practical implementations, this work contributes to the growing body of literature on likelihood-free inference and serves as a valuable resource for researchers confronting complex models where traditional likelihood-based methods are impractical.
