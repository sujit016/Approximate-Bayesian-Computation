## Approximate Bayesian Computation
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) constitutes a robust theoretical framework for executing 
Bayesian inference in contexts where the likelihood function is either analytically intractable or 
computationally excessive. Rather than directly assessing likelihoods, ABC operates by simulating data 
from the model and juxtaposing it with the observed data through the utilization of summary statistics. 
Given that the summary statistics may not consistently suffice or may be unavailable, pointwise 
comparisons between observed and simulated data points are frequently employed as an alternative.
